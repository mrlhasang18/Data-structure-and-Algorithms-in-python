Defination: 
- Tree is a non-linear,recursion and hierarchical datastructure that contains multiple nodes in different level and 
  the nodes can be connected by directed or undirected edges.

Understanding:
- we use tree when we have heirerchail order:
- Top of the tree is called root node:                           Level 0
- middle ones are just called node.                              Level 1
- and the nodes that doesn't have children is called leaf node.  level 2: for only 2 generation

Binary Tree:
- It is just like a general tree with 2 exceptions:
  - Every node has atmust 2 child nodes
  - Binary search Tree or BST
    - Special case of binary tree WHERE:
      - Left hand node has less value and right has higher value 
      - Elements are not duplicatied(i.e. unique value)

Search Complexity:
- Every iteration we reduce search space by 1/2
  - for n=8  8->4->2->1
  - 3 iteration
  -log2(8) = 3
  - Search Complexity = O(log n)

Searching Algorithm in BST:
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search    : Always lefts of tree and then rights of tree
  - Inorder Traversal   : lefts of tree, recursion and after lefts of tree is done then rights of tree
    - your root node in between 
  - Postorder Traversal : 
    - your root node at right
  - Preorder Traversal
    - root node a
