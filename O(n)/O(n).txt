
Lets understand Big O Notation

-> Big O Notation: 
- It measures the worst case complexity of an algorithm
   - Time complexity : time taken to run completely
   - Space complexity: extra memory Space
- It doesn't use seconds/bytes:
   - cause the result is different depending on the hardware
- Mathematical Expressions:
   -O(1), O(n), O(n^2), ...
